## Assignment Details ##

Define specific use cases in which credit card transaction data can add real value. The goal is to discover different insights from the data through 5 - 8 data visualization (with GGPlot2) and then transform them into potential business outcomes. Insights are wanted, Design is secondary.

The dataset consists of 10,000 credit card transactions performed by tourists in the city of Madrid during a month.

## Final Report ##

#### INTRODUCTION ####

The analysis of tourists’ credit card transactions can provide a deeper understanding on travel spending, allowing to identify trends and highlights in consumption patterns from visitors. This report focuses on the analysis of credit card transactions performed by tourists in the city of Madrid, Spain, between March 2nd and 3rd, 2012. The data available includes information about the amount, country of origin, spending category and timing of a transaction.
Within the 48 hours of data available, we found 110 different nationalities to be present, 10.793 transactions and €1.173.584 in purchases. As will be elaborated later in the report, the countries with the highest spending were the United States, Great Britain, China, France and Japan. In addition, most expenses during the 48 hours were concentrated among three main categories: “Fashion & Shoes”, “Bars & Restaurants” and “Accommodation”.
The exploratory analysis of the dataset revealed interesting patterns of consumer behavior of different nationalities, which present distinct characteristics in terms of spending category, timing of purchase and average ticket value, which will be further explained below.
Lastly, some potential data monetization strategies are discussed in the final part of the report, which focuses on how the discovered insights and patterns can be used as input for search engine keywords pricing strategies. The genesis for this project was to determine how Citibank can better monetize its current transactional data and present a set of recommendations at Citibank’s annual convention. As a result of the data exploration, this report recommends a partnership and pilot program with Google using Citibank’s transactional data.
